## Requirements

- NVIDIA gpu capable of running CUDA
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit

## Installation

1) Follow the instructions here to install NVIDIA Container Toolkit<br />
https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html

2) Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ground-creative/openvoice-docker.git
```

3) Select an Ubuntu image that is compatible with the NVIDIA driver version u plan to use from here<br />
https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/tags

&emsp;You can find out which version is supported by your driver in one of the following ways:

* With CUDA installed
```
nvcc --version
```

* Without CUDA you can look at the driver version on your system and check compatibility from here<br />
https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html


4) Change environment variables in env.sample file and rename it to .env

* Remember to add the correct CUDA image in the env file. Ex: DOCKER_IMAGE=nvidia/cuda:12.5.0-devel-ubuntu22.04

* You can remove the link to the api from the env file if you jut want to install OpenVoice

## Usage

Add the correct permissions when installing OpenVoice and/or API folders
```
USRID=$(id -u) GRPID=$(id -g) docker compose --project-name=openvoice up -d --build
```
Or
```
docker compose --project-name=openvoice up -d
```
Or
```
docker compose --project-name=openvoice up -d --build
```

Watch docker logs when you install first time as the container will need to install various dependencies
```
docker logs -f -t {CONTAINER_NAME}
```

You can check api logs in logs folder
```
tail -f app.log
```

### Command Environment Variables

It's possible to override environmet variable file while building a container as shown below:
```
TEST=true COMMAND="tail -f /dev/null" docker compose --project-name=openvoice up -d
```
